Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to automate the design of dental fillings. We first procedurally generate a large-scale dataset of 3D tooth models with realistic cavities and their perfectly fitting fillings. Then, we use this dataset to train a 3D U-Net, a deep learning architecture, to learn the complex mapping from a cavity's shape to its corresponding filling.
